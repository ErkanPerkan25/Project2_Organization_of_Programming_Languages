# Parser
**Project2 - Organization Of Programming Languages** <br>
To build a parser and code summarizer for a programming language using the tools **bison** and **flex++**<br>
Author: **Eric Hansson**

- Platform:<br>
Arch Linux

- Details to compile program:<br>
To compile the program you run the command `make` as it has a Makefile,
it should create a executable called **p2sol**<br>

```
make
```

- Details to run program: 
To run the program you run the following command with a input file:<br>
```
./p2sol <input_file>
```

- Or run the program and enter in the code with the command line:<br>
```
./p2sol
```

- Any known bugs?
I have not come around any bugs with my program. I have tried a few different type of the test cases to 
see if there are any bugs to are hidden. But I have not found any.

- Overview of solving project:
To solve this project I looked at the where the grammar declared variables and focus on make in the
count of variables work first. And then I focused on making the counting and printing of the functions
to work.
